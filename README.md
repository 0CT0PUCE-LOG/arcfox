# What is ArcFox?
<img src="screenshot.png"/>

ArcFox is a pack of firefox improvements that brings the appearance and some of the features of arc browser to firefox. Recently, The Browser Company © (the developers of arc browser) announced a windows version, so this project almost lost the reason to exist. But there still a linux version to be made and some people just like firefox and don't want to change.

I really recomend you to give a try on arc browser if you can. But we gonna do our best to make firefox nice as arc.

# Installation
We are working on a installer for arcfox, but while it's not done to use ArcFox you need to install arcfox-core and arcfox-theme (in this specific order). To proceed with the instalation, use the tutorial below. Using arcfox-core and arcfox-theme together is the best way to use ArcFox!
